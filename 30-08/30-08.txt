Understanding Linux File System:

Types of files:

Directories
Special file - mechanism used for I/O. /dev holds special files
Links - way to make file or directory visible in multiple parts of the os
Sockets - Provides inter process networking such as TCP/IP
Pipes - allows IPC

/bin - binary
/sbin - system binaries
/etc - Contains system-wide config files
/opt - cntains third party packages
/media - mount point for removable media
/boot - Holds files required in os boot
/dev - device files

touch -> changes file's timestamps and creates a new file if one doesnt exist

Components:

1) the boot block - contains small boot program
2) the super block - contains global information about the filesystem
3) the inode block - Contains a table for every file of the system. All 
		     attributes of a file and directory are stored in this area
		     except the name of the file and the actual data. 
4) the data block - Contains all data and programs created by user reside 
		    in this area

THe file system layout

	| |Boot block| super block | Inode| |data block| |blocks| |


Q) Make a program of swapping two variables without using third variable 
in shell
